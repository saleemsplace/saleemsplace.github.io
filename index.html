        Hello, My Name is Saleem Nora, I am a Los Angeles based junior web devoloper. When im not sitting behind my desk learning aquiring knowledge, 
        im sitting behind my desk playing strategy based games. I love to challenge myself and keep my mind active. I LOVE all things technology and often NEED to
         have whats new on the market. Going out is fun and all, but unless its to a concert, I would rather not. Basicall I love music, technology, anime and programing.
